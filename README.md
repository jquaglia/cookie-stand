# LAB - Number 8b

## Salmon Cookies

I built an Object Constructor! The constructor calculates the daily total and hourly sales of Salmon Cookies! It also outputs this info in the form of a list for multiple different cities on my sales.html page. It's now much more neat and improved to be DRY compared to Lab 6. I've also added a form to add new stores to the list and to add the total.

### Reflections and Comments

* I HATE CSS. Even when it's going well, it takes way too long to get anything accomplished.

* This was difficult at first! I really felt lost during the hourly sales function. I welcome the challenge! I actually feel so fulfilled at the end of a day like today!

* I'm realizing now that stacked module learning is taking affect and it actually feels like it's working. I already have a much better concept of week 1 content.
