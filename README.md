# LAB - Number 6

## Salmon Cookies

I built an object! The object calculates the daily total and hourly sales of Salmon Cookies! It also outputs this info in the form of a list for multiple different cities on my sales.html page.

### Reflections and Comments

* This was difficult at first! I really felt lost during the hourly sales function. I welcome the challenge! I actually feel so fulfilled at the end of a day like today!
